@claude list the files in this directory
@gemini read the package.json file
```

## üìÅ File Operations

### Reading Files

```bash
# Read entire file

@gemini read src/index.ts starting from line 10, show 20 lines

# Read configuration files
@claude what's in the package.json?
@gemini show me the tsconfig.json contents
```

### Writing Files

```bash
# Create a simple script
@gemini write a hello world script to hello.js

# Create with specific content
@claude write "console.log('Open CLI is awesome!')" to test.js

# Create in subdirectory (will create directories)
@gemini create a new file at src/utils/helper.js with utility functions

# Write multi-line content
@claude write a README for this project to docs/README.md with installation instructions
```

### Directory Operations

```bash

# 2. Use @gemini to implement
# 3. Use @claude to review and refine

# Keep context
# Each model maintains separate conversation history
# Reference previous responses: "implement the solution you just suggested"
```

### Safety and Best Practices

```bash
# Always review generated code
@claude review this generated code for security issues
@gemini check this code for potential bugs

# Test incrementally
# Generate small pieces and test them before building larger features

# Use version control
# Make commits after successful generations to track changes
```
